02/15/2023 - User database setup and login function working

02/16/2023 - Add user function working (need to implement confirmation message and check for dups)

02/16/2023 V2 - Add user function now has working confirmation message

02/16/2023 V3 - Item database and add item function working with confirmation message

02/17/2023 - Recycler view implemented

02/18/2023 - Primary keys now working for login and item databases. 14 hours of my life I'll never get back...

02/18/2023 V2 - Successfully passing values from recycler view to update item activity (including auto populating item details)

02/19/2023 (No File) - I pulled an all nighter trying, for over 12 hours straight, how to update the data in the recycler view
                       for the items. I can't do it. It appears as if the function is working but not returning the new record
                       back to the database.
