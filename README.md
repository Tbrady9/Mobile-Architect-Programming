02/15/2023 - User database setup and login function working

02/16/2023 - Add user function working (need to implement confirmation message and check for dups)

02/16/2023 V2 - Add user function now has working confirmation message

02/16/2023 V3 - Item database and add item function working with confirmation message

02/17/2023 - Recycler view implemented

02/18/2023 - Primary keys now working for login and item databases.

02/18/2023 V2 - Successfully passing values from recycler view to update item activity (including auto populating item details)

02/19/2023 - It took me 14 hours to figure out why I couldn't get my update function to work for the items. Turns out
             I was passing the text field instead of the list.
                       
02/21/2023 - Ran into another issue last night where trying to implement requesting permissions caused me to notice that my database
             hadn't been updating in quite some time. After hours of searching, I found a few issues with naming and an if statement.
             This version has a working delete function and working permission request toggle.
             
02/22/2023 - Final product - Completed the notifications implementation with a customizable setting for when to notify of low inventory.
              Also performed some random cleanup and organization of the code.
